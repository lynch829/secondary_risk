% DEFAULT_PATH is the initial path that the "Browse" button will point to.

% a fraction

% PARAM_PATH defines the folder containing the parameters. Can also be set
% to 'uigetdir', in which the user will be prompted when the application 
% loads.

% DEFAULT_FRACTIONS sets the number of fractions to divide the dose by when

% loaded, the planned fractions will override this value.
